## Project Idea
Our project is based on a core gameplay function from Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild; we aim to make a comprehensive cookbook for the various food recipes in-game.

## Project Background/Business Opportunity
Cooking in Breath of the Wild is something they teach you how to do, but not what to cook. There's no in-game log of recipes you've made or can make. You get quests sometimes to cook different items, and it's time to hit the Google machine to find a recipe. We wanted to make something fun and convenient to put those recipes together for players who want to learn how to cook.

## Project Board
Our [Kanban board](https://github.com/users/mikaylapeterson/projects/1/views/2) is publicly accessible.
